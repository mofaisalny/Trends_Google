Hi, This is Faisal. I submitted my test but it was an unsuccessful attempts. I tried several way 
including Angular but unable to find locator for couples of element. 

I share my framework which is setup by me and done all of the step to finish the test.
I created two different class in test run and test page. One is for collecting all of the repository and 
another one is for run the test. I just need to provide the locator in the repository class. 

Anyway, thanks for giving me the chance till here. I really like the interview and all of the member from interview board. 
Stay safe guys.
